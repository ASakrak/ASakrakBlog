            <h2>Religions Phenomenon</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                For a while, I'm thinking these phenomenon and trying find a sensible solutions in my mind. And I just
                handle the subject from objective perspective. Incidentally, I am not opposite to religions, gods or
                religious philosophical ideas.
                <br><br>
                Religion and god idea has existed since the beginning of humanity. First of all, I want to start with
                this example, today's mythologies was yesterday's religions. E.g., Old Germans was believe “Wodan” as
                god of thunders and they thought he was real. After a while they realized he wasn't real and not exist.
                There are many mythological examples like this from different folks. Who believes in Pegasus in the 21st
                century? but still there are many people who believe in different similar creatures from dissimilar
                cultures.
                <br><br>
                From beginning of humanity, the main reasons behind of these beliefs are fear, helplessness, belief in
                life after death due to fear of death. we can find a lot of instances to these reasons from the history.
                And I think that's why human race believe this phenomenon.
                It's normal, everyone experiences these feelings. Maybe these feelings making us humans.
                <br><br>
                On the other hand, if we handle the subject as a scientifical perspective. God and Religions phenomenon
                is relative subject. No one can prove and believing is depend on the person and their feelings.
                <br>
                Incidentally, If I turn back to my idea and first example, today's religions and their gods will be
                yesterday's mythologies. And this is a inevitable end. In near future, developed nations and their
                people will stop believing to religions and god.
                <br><br>
                Thank you for reading.
