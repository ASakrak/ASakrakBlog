            <h2>What am I doing on these days</h2>

                Hallo, I'm Ahmet Sakrak. On this blog, i'm gonna talk about my last days.
                First, i started learn German 3 month ago. I practice speaking every day,
                Probably 2 hour sometimes 3 hour per a day. And i'll write some blogs in German
                because i need improve my writing skills. I mostly practice speaking.

                I want to write about games, movies, series, books and programming.
                Actually i opened this blog for writing about this topics. I could probably spare 45 minutes every day.

                <br><br>
                Nowadays, i'm playing some games
                like Elden Ring, Metal Slug and Factorio. Despite my university entry exam.
                Everyday, i'm studying. Especially math and physics. It's so hard, i want to study physics engineering.
                <br>
                We have a project about a natural disaster. We are writing an article. We started last month and focused
                on this project. And we have deadline next april. I want to publish after the competition if it's
                possible.
